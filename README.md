# booksApi

A simple repo for remembering how to use Java Spring Stack by creating a books REST API using my favorites/new tools.

# Stack

* Docker for managing dev && production environment
* Swagger for auto generating docs
* Postgresql for the database
* Java Spring Boot for the backend
* Mockito && Junit for unit testing
* Github workflow as CI/CD
* IAC (not decided yet)
